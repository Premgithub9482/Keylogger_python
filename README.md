# Keylogger_python
 Simple Python Keylogger
This repository contains a basic Python keylogger script built using the `pynput` library. The keylogger captures alphanumeric characters and spaces, logging them to a file. The logging process is initiated by running the script, and it continues until the 'Esc' key is pressed.

 Usage:

1. Install Dependencies:
   bash
   pip install pynput
   

2. Run the Keylogger:
   bash
   python keylogger.py
   

3. Terminate the Keylogger:
   Press the 'Esc' key to stop the keylogger. The collected keystrokes will be written to "logger.txt."

Note:

- Use this script responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit permission to monitor or log keystrokes.
- Unauthorized use may lead to legal consequences and violates privacy norms.
