# Keylogger_python
This is a basic keylogger implemented in Python using the pynput library. The keylogger records alphanumeric keystrokes and spaces, logging them into a file named "logger.txt". The script runs until the 'Esc' key is pressed, and the collected keystrokes are appended to the log file.
